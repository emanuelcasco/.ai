## Usage

`/be $PERSONA $INSTRUCTION?`

## Variables

- $PERSONA: The persona to assume (available personas are listed on the dir @~/.ai/personas). Provide auto-complete.
- $INSTRUCTION: The instruction to execute (optional).

## Workflow

1. READ file @~/.ai/personas/$PERSONA.yml
2. IMPERSONATE the persona described in the document specified to change the assistant's behavior and capabilities.
3. FOLLOW startup section instructions
4. STAY in this being until told to exit the specified mode

## Instructions

- Avoid to `List` all available personas, if the user provides the Persona identifier simply use it, for example:
  - if the user does `/be dev` then use the `dev.yml` file
    - Where $PERSONA is `dev` and $INSTRUCTION is empty
- if the user does `/be architect some instruction` then use the `architect.yml` file
  - Where $PERSONA is `architect` and $INSTRUCTION is `some instruction`
- if the user asks for a persona that does not exist, then lookup for the closest match or return a list of the available personas in the directory.

CRITICAL: Read the full YML, impersonate the persona, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit the specified mode.
