type: task
mode: think harder
---

## Purpose

Create comprehensive research prompts for deep analysis from brainstorming sessions, project briefs, market research, or specific questions.

## Workflow

### 1. Research Focus Options

Present these numbered options to the user:

1. **Product Validation Research**

   - Validate product hypotheses and market fit
   - Test assumptions about user needs and solutions
   - Assess technical and business feasibility
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies

2. **Market Opportunity Research**

   - Analyze market size and growth potential
   - Identify market segments and dynamics
   - Assess market entry strategies
   - Evaluate timing and market readiness

3. **User & Customer Research**

   - Deep dive into user personas and behaviors
   - Understand jobs-to-be-done and pain points
   - Map customer journeys and touchpoints
   - Analyze willingness to pay and value perception

4. **Competitive Intelligence Research**

   - Detailed competitor analysis and positioning
   - Feature and capability comparisons
   - Business model and strategy analysis
   - Identify competitive advantages and gaps

5. **Technology & Innovation Research**

   - Assess technology trends and possibilities
   - Evaluate technical approaches and architectures
   - Identify emerging technologies and disruptions
   - Analyze build vs. buy vs. partner options

6. **Industry & Ecosystem Research**

   - Map industry value chains and dynamics
   - Identify key players and relationships
   - Analyze regulatory and compliance factors
   - Understand partnership opportunities

7. **Strategic Options Research**

   - Evaluate different strategic directions
   - Assess business model alternatives
   - Analyze go-to-market strategies
   - Consider expansion and scaling paths

8. **Risk & Feasibility Research**

   - Identify and assess various risk factors
   - Evaluate implementation challenges
   - Analyze resource requirements
   - Consider regulatory and legal implications

9. **Custom Research Focus**
   [[LLM: Allow user to define their own specific research focus.]]
   - User-defined research objectives
   - Specialized domain investigation
   - Cross-functional research needs

### 2. Input Processing

**Project Brief**: Extract product concepts, users, constraints, assumptions
**Brainstorming**: Synthesize themes, validation areas, hypotheses
**Market Research**: Build on opportunities, deepen insights, validate findings
**Starting Fresh**: Gather context, define problem space, set objectives

### 3. Research Prompt Structure

[[LLM: Collaboratively develop comprehensive research prompt with these components.]]

#### A. Research Objectives
[[LLM: Articulate clear, specific research objectives.]]
- Primary goal and purpose
- Key decisions to inform
- Success criteria
- Constraints and boundaries

#### B. Research Questions
[[LLM: Develop specific, actionable questions by theme.]]
**Core**: Central must-answer questions with priorities and dependencies
**Supporting**: Context-building, nice-to-have, future considerations

#### C. Research Methodology
[[LLM: Specify methods based on type and objectives.]]
**Data Collection**: Sources, approaches, quality/credibility requirements
**Analysis**: Frameworks, criteria, methodologies, synthesis approaches

#### D. Output Requirements
[[LLM: Define findings structure and presentation.]]
**Format**: Executive summary, detailed findings, visuals, documentation
**Deliverables**: Key insights, decision support, recommendations, risk documentation

### 4. Prompt Generation

[[LLM: Synthesize all elements into a comprehensive, ready-to-use research prompt.]]

**Research Prompt Template:**

```
## Research Objective
[Clear statement of what this research aims to achieve]

## Background Context

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)
1. [Specific, actionable question]
2. [Specific, actionable question]
...

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)
1. [Supporting question]
2. [Supporting question]
...

## Research Methodology

### Information Sources
- [Specific source types and priorities]

### Analysis Frameworks

```

### 5. Review and Refinement

[[LLM: Present draft research prompt for review and refinement.]]

1. **Present Complete Prompt**: Show full prompt, explain elements, highlight assumptions
2. **Gather Feedback**: Validate objectives, questions, scope, output requirements
3. **Refine**: Incorporate feedback, adjust scope, add missing elements, clarify ambiguities

### 6. Next Steps Guidance

[[LLM: Provide clear guidance on research prompt usage.]]

**Execution Options**: AI research assistant, human research framework, or hybrid approach

**Integration Points**: Phase integration, team review, validation methods, expansion triggers

## Instructions

- Research prompt quality directly impacts insight quality
- Use specific rather than general questions
- Consider current state and future implications
- Balance comprehensiveness with focus
